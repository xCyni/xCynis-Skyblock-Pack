### What version should I use?

There are three different versions of the pack as of version v3.0, **Full**, **Overlay**, and **FPS Friendly**.
Versions before v3.0 will only have two versions of the pack, **Full** and **Overlay**.

#### Full
The Full version offers the full immersive experience, including all of the item textures, Minecraft assets (Compliance), and mod guis.
#### Overlay
The Overlay version has the same things as the Full version, but without the Minecraft assets.
#### FPS Friendly
The FPS Friendly version has only the Skyblock textures. It does not include the Minecraft assets, mod guis, or even animations. It also removes more useless textures.
